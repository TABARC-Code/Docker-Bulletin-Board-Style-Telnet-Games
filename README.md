# Docker-Bulletin-Board-Style-Telnet-Games
a collection of classic ASCII like games such as Hunt the Wumpus, snake game, etc. They are Recreated from memory of those late-night sessions telnetting into forgotten servers. i wasbored and this was a nic bit of nostolga


##The Idea
Back in the day, these games lived on servers. You'd be poking around, checking out /usr/local/games/, and there they were. No fanfare, no documentation, just there. This Docker setup recreates that.
